## Executive Summary

### Business Problem

Retail organizations often lack consolidated visibility into sales performance across regions, segments, and product categories—making it difficult to identify underperforming areas, track profitability trends, and understand return patterns that erode margins.

**Key Challenges:**
- Regional performance discrepancies hidden in raw data
- Profit margins vulnerable to untracked discount erosion
- Return patterns not linked to manager accountability
- Lack of trend visibility prevents proactive decision-making

✅ **Revenue Opportunity** - Quickly identify high-performing categories and regions to expand  
✅ **Risk Mitigation** - Surface underperforming segments before losses compound  
✅ **Inventory Optimization** - Use segment and category insights for smarter allocation  
✅ **Accountability** - Link manager performance to regional returns and profitability  
✅ **Trend Analysis** - Year-over-year comparisons enable early intervention
